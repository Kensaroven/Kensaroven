## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### This is Ken Saroven and I am a graduate student and an aspiring data scientist

My passion for data and the business impacts of data are never ending, as I age through and witness the wonders it can perform. I am an experienced data scientist with 4 years of work experience in the field of analytics and wish to contribute more over challenging business problems.

I am an avid marathoner, pencil artist and a music lover. I would love to express more of me.
